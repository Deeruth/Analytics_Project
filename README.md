### Project Overview

This project aims to analyze sales data from an ERP system in the pharmaceutical industry to drive growth and optimize the supply chain. By leveraging data analytics techniques and visualization tools, we aim to identify patterns, trends, and insights from various data sources

### Data Sources

The data sources includes: order, order group, region, state, customers, products, and category tables. These tables contain detailed information about all the sales made by the company, enabling us to make informed decisions to enhance sales performance and distribution efficiency.

### Proposed Features
Data Collection and Preprocessing Module (MySQL) (Google sheet)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Module (MySQL, Google Sheets)
Visualization Module (Power BI)
Presentation Module (PowerPoint)

### Tools
Database: MySQL Server (ERP data source)
Data Visualization: Google Sheets, Power BI
Creating report & Presentation: PowerPoint

### Milestones
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing : Handling missing values and formatting
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
   EDA answered the following:
     - What is the overall sales trend per week and month?
     - What's the number of buying customer in a week?
     - Which products and category are top sellers weekly?
     - What are peak sales periods?
     - Who are the top 10 weekly customers?
     - Which region has the highest mumber of buying customers
     - What's the average order value?
4. Visualization and Dashboard Creation
5. Presentation Preparation


### Data Analysis Code
Include some interesting code/features I worked with;
```sql ````


### Results
The analysis results are summarised as follows:

1. Sales Trends: Through exploratory data analysis, we identified seasonal fluctuations and trends in sales across different regions and product categories in August.
2. Customer Behavior: Analysis revealed patterns in customer purchasing behavior, such as preferred products, order frequency, and order size.
3. Product Performance: Certain products showed consistently high sales, while others exhibited potential for improvement.
4. Regional Variances: Sales performance varied significantly across different regions, indicating opportunities for targeted marketing and sales strategies
5. Correlation: There's a positive correlation between both sales and acquisition rate.



 ### Recommendations
 Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:
- Implement targeted marketing campaigns based on customer segmentation and purchasing patterns identified through data analysis.
- Optimize product offerings and pricing strategies based on insights into product performance and customer preferences.
- Strengthen distribution channels in regions with high sales potential and invest in sales force training and support.
- Leverage predictive modeling to forecast future sales and inventory requirements, enabling proactive inventory management



 ### Limitations

- Data Quality: The analysis is contingent upon the quality and completeness of the data extracted from the ERP system. Inaccuracies or inconsistencies in the data may impact the validity of findings.
- Scope: The analysis focuses primarily on sales data and may not capture other factors influencing sales performance, such as market trends, competitor activities, or external economic factors.
- Technical Constraints: Limitations in computational resources or software capabilities may restrict the complexity of analysis or the scale of data processed.
- Generalizability: Findings and recommendations may not be universally applicable and should be interpreted within the context of the specific business and market environment
